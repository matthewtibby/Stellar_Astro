## üì∏ Calibration Frame Types & What You Can Do

### 1. **Master Dark**
- **Purpose:** Removes thermal noise and hot pixels from your light frames.
- **Beginner Mode:**
  - Choose stacking method: **Median** (default, robust to outliers) or **Mean** (improves SNR, less robust to outliers).
- **Advanced Mode:**
  - Stacking method: Median, Mean, Winsorized Sigma Clipping, Linear Fit Clipping
  - Sigma/Kappa threshold (for outlier rejection methods)
  - Dark frame scaling (enable/disable, set scaling factor)
  - Bias subtraction (enable/disable)
  - Amp glow suppression (enable/disable)
  - Temperature matching (enable/disable)
  - Exposure time matching (enable/disable)
  - Cosmetic correction (enable/disable, choose method, set threshold)
  - Custom rejection expression (for expert users)
- **Tips:**
  - Use darks that match your lights in exposure, temperature, and ISO/gain for best results.
  - Enable advanced options only if you know your data needs them.

### 2. **Master Flat**
- **Purpose:** Corrects for vignetting, dust, and optical artifacts in your images.
- **Beginner Mode:**
  - Choose stacking method: **Mean**, **Median**, or **Min/Max Rejection**
- **Advanced Mode:**
  - Stacking method: Sigma Clipping, Winsorized Sigma Clipping, Linear Fit Clipping, Adaptive Weighted Average, Entropy Weighted Average
  - Sigma/Kappa threshold (for relevant methods)
  - Weight parameter (for weighted methods)
  - Cosmetic correction (enable/disable, choose method, set threshold)
  - Custom rejection expression
- **Tips:**
  - Take flats with the same optical setup as your lights (focus, filters, camera orientation).
  - Use Min/Max or Sigma Clipping if you have dust motes or outliers.

### 3. **Master Bias**
- **Purpose:** Removes electronic read noise from your images.
- **Beginner Mode:**
  - Stacking method: **Median** (default)
- **Advanced Mode:**
  - Stacking method: Median, Sigma Clipping, Winsorized Sigma Clipping, Linear Fit Clipping
  - Sigma/Kappa threshold (for relevant methods)
  - Cosmetic correction (enable/disable, choose method, set threshold)
  - Custom rejection expression
- **Tips:**
  - Bias frames should be the shortest possible exposure with the lens/cap on.
  - Median stacking is usually sufficient for bias frames.

## üßë‚Äçüíª General Calibration Tips
- **Beginner Mode:**
  - Designed for simplicity and best practices. Most users will get great results with default settings.
- **Advanced Mode:**
  - Unlocks expert controls for power users. Only change advanced settings if you understand their impact.
- **Tooltips:**
  - Hover over info icons in the UI for detailed explanations of each option.
- **Diagnostics:**
  - After calibration, review histograms and diagnostics to check for issues (e.g., outliers, amp glow, uneven flats).
- **Reproducibility:**
  - All calibration steps and settings are logged for traceability. You can download reports for your records.
