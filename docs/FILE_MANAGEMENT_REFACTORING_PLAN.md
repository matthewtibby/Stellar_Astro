## 🎯 REFACTORING OBJECTIVES

### **Current State Analysis**
- **File**: `src/components/FileManagementPanel.tsx`
- **Current Size**: 550 lines
- **Target Size**: Under 130 lines (75-80% reduction)
- **Complexity**: Very High - 15+ useState hooks, multiple business domains
- **Pattern**: Following successful CreateSuperdarkUI refactoring (932 → 117 lines, 87% reduction)

### **Identified Complexity Issues**
1. **State Management Explosion**: 15+ useState hooks managing different concerns
2. **Mixed Business Logic**: File operations, preview generation, validation mixed with UI
3. **Multiple UI Domains**: File tabs, upload area, preview modals, search/filter
4. **Handler Function Sprawl**: 10+ handler functions scattered throughout component
5. **Inline Business Logic**: File validation, preview caching, search logic embedded in component

### **Refactoring Strategy (5 Phases)**

#### **Phase 1: Extract Constants and Types** ✅ COMPLETE
**Target**: Create dedicated files for constants and type definitions
- Extract file type constants and labels to `src/components/file-management/constants/fileConstants.ts`
- Extract all type definitions to `src/components/file-management/types/fileManagement.types.ts`
- Create barrel exports with `index.ts` files
- **Expected Reduction**: 40-60 lines

#### **Phase 2: Service Layer Extraction**
**Target**: Extract all business logic into dedicated service classes
- Create `FileOperationsService.ts` for upload, download, delete operations
- Create `PreviewService.ts` for image generation, caching, and URL management
- Create `ValidationService.ts` for FITS file validation and error handling
- Create `SearchService.ts` for search, filtering, and file organization logic
- **Expected Reduction**: 150-200 lines

#### **Phase 3: Custom Hooks Extraction**
**Target**: Extract state management into custom hooks
- Create `useFileState.ts` for file loading, management, and type organization
- Create `usePreviewState.ts` for preview modal, caching, and loading states
- Create `useSearchState.ts` for search, filter, tab navigation, and UI state
- Create `useFileOperations.ts` for file operation handlers and lifecycle management
- **Expected Reduction**: 100-150 lines

#### **Phase 4: UI Component Extraction**
**Target**: Extract large UI blocks into reusable components
- Create `FileTypeNavigation.tsx` for left sidebar with file type tabs and counts
- Create `FileListDisplay.tsx` for main file listing with actions and metadata
- Create `SearchAndFilter.tsx` for search input, tag filtering, and controls
- Create `PreviewModal.tsx` for file preview modal system with error handling
- Create `UploadArea.tsx` for drag-and-drop upload section with validation
- **Expected Reduction**: 150-200 lines

#### **Phase 5: Final Optimization**
**Target**: Final cleanup and optimization
- Combine related components where beneficial
- Optimize hook usage and eliminate prop drilling
- Create composite components for complex UI patterns
- Final cleanup of any remaining complexity
- **Expected Reduction**: 50-100 lines

### **Success Metrics**
- **Primary Goal**: Reduce main component to under 130 lines (75-80% reduction)
- **Architecture Goal**: Clean separation of concerns across 15+ specialized files
- **Maintainability Goal**: Each file should have a single responsibility
- **Testability Goal**: Business logic should be easily unit testable
- **Reusability Goal**: Components and hooks should be reusable across the app
