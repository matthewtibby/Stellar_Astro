const fileOperations = useFileOperations(userId, projectId, selectedType); // selectedType not yet defined
const { selectedType, setSelectedType } = calibrationState;

// AFTER (Fixed)
const { selectedType, setSelectedType } = calibrationState;
const fileOperations = useFileOperations(userId, projectId, selectedType); // selectedType now available
```

#### 2. Duplicate State Management (FIXED ✅)
**Issue**: `setShowQualityReport` existed both locally and in modalManagement hook
```javascript
// BEFORE (Conflict)
const [showQualityReport, setShowQualityReport] = useState(false); // Local state
const modalManagement = useModalManagement(); // Also exports setShowQualityReport

// AFTER (Consolidated)
const { showQualityReport, setShowQualityReport } = modalManagement; // Single source of truth
```
