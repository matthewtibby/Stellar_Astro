## Merged Detailed Items from Other Backlog Files

### Undo Project Deletion
- **Description:** After deleting a project, show an 'Undo' option for a short window (e.g., 5 seconds). If the user clicks 'Undo', restore the project and its files to the dashboard. Requires backend support for soft-deletion or a temporary trash bin to allow restoration. Improves user experience and prevents accidental data loss.
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Status:** Backlog
- **Steps:**
  1. Implement soft-delete or trash bin in backend
  2. Show undo UI in frontend after deletion
  3. Restore project/files if undo is clicked

### Persist FITS Metadata in Backend (COMPLETED)
- **Description:** When a FITS file is uploaded and validated, store the extracted metadata (exposure time, gain, telescope, filter, instrument, object, date_obs, binning, focal length, RA, DEC, etc.) in a database or as part of the file's metadata in storage. Update the file listing API to return this metadata with each file. This will allow the frontend to always display rich metadata in info popovers, even after reloads or across devices.
- **Benefits:**
  - Consistent, reliable metadata display for all files.
  - Enables advanced search, filtering, and sorting by metadata fields in the future.
  - Reduces need to re-validate or re-parse FITS files on demand.
- **Steps:**
  1. Update backend to save metadata on upload/validation. **(DONE)**
  2. Update file listing endpoint to include metadata. **(DONE)**
  3. Update frontend to use metadata from API response. **(DONE)**

### Upload Utility Improvements
#### Duplicate File Handling
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Status:** Backlog
- **Description:** Implement a mechanism to handle duplicate filenames by appending a counter (e.g., `filename_1.fit`, `filename_2.fit`) when files with the same name are uploaded.
- **Steps:**
  1. Add a check in the Python worker's `validate_fits_file` function
  2. Query the database to check for existing files with the same name
  3. Append a counter if duplicates are found
  4. Update the file path accordingly
- **Benefits:** Prevents file overwrites and maintains data integrity

#### Path Validation Enhancement
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Status:** Backlog
- **Description:** Add robust path validation in the `getFitsFileUrl` function to ensure path structure matches the expected format.
- **Steps:**
  1. Add validation for path structure: `{user_id}/{project_id}/{file_type}/{filename}`
  2. Implement regex pattern matching for path validation
  3. Add detailed error messages for invalid paths
  4. Log validation failures for debugging
- **Benefits:** Improves error handling and debugging capabilities

### Onboarding Tour Improvements
- **Description:**
  - Integrate onboarding tour with real dashboard elements: Home page, all projects, new projects, collaboration, community wall.
  - Use real element selectors and highlight actual UI.
  - Remove demo/example tour when real tour is ready.
  - Make tour config-driven and user-dismissable.
  - Polish overlay, step navigation, and progress indicators.
- **Priority:** High

### Collaboration Feature
- **Description:**
  - Add real-time collaboration for projects (placeholder for now)
  - UI for inviting collaborators and working together
  - Permissions and activity feed for collaboration
- **Priority:** High
